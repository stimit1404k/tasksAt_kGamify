## 🧩 Tasks & Contributions

### ✅ Task 1: Implementing a Shareable Card Feature for Social Media

**🗓️ Date:** April 16, 2025

**Objective:**  
Design and implement a card component within a Flutter app that can be shared as an image on social platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.

**How I Handled It:**

- ✅ Designed a visually appealing `Card` widget using Flutter’s `Container`, `Card`, and `Text` widgets.
- ✅ Wrapped the card inside a `RepaintBoundary` to capture it as an image.
- ✅ Used `RenderRepaintBoundary` and `toImage()` to convert the widget to a `Uint8List`.
- ✅ Saved the image using the `path_provider` package.
- ✅ Shared the image using the `share_plus` package.

**Technologies & Packages Used:**

- `Flutter`
- `path_provider`
- `share_plus`

**Outcome:**  
Successfully created a shareable card that works seamlessly across multiple platforms, enhancing the social reach and user engagement of the app.
